# The Idris2-Chem Tutorial: An Introduction to Dependently Typed Cheminformatics

In this tutorial we will first give an introduction into the
main aspekts of the Idris2 programming language and apply
the concepts we learn to the field of cheminformatics.

For the time being, I'll assume some familiarity with a similar
programming language like Haskell, as many things in Idris2
are very similar.
